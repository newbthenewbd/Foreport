# Preamble
Do you use Minecraft 1.12 only because you _have_ to? Do you _hate_ how the game feels with the "improvements" brought about by Minecraft 1.12? Do you wish that Minecraft _took a step back_ for the better?

So it just now did! **Foreport** is a mod conceived by regular Minecraft players like you, after we identified the problems because of which we replied with a strong **yes** to all the above questions. With Foreport installed, the replies to the first and second question become a strong **nope** — it becomes visible that 1.12 actually introduces a variety of _true_ improvements to the game, only overshadowed by the things broken in that version — and fixed in Foreport!

# Features
But wait, what does Foreport even change? The quasi-hellish experience of vanilla 1.12, along with how slick and performant Foreport is, just makes it kind of hard to remember. Let's look in the Foreporter's Log™!

* Hooray, a clean, modern Minecraft version with the horrible bugs fixed! Wait, did I somehow become morbidly obese? **Why do I bury in the ground while sneaking?** Time to get that exercise!
* Yay, I am now fit and no longer bury in the ground! **But hold on, why am I unable to walk backwards normally?** Is it because of the trashy corset that they forced onto me during the update? Whew, took it off, back to sanity!
* ~~Achiev^H^H^H^H^H^H~~ Advancements warrant these notification boxes called _toasts_ to appear, because advancements are awesome. **But why am I rewarded with toasts, or perhaps penalized considering their frequency, every single time I find a recipe?** Let's hire a wizard to only pass the advancement ones!
* **Did anyone mention a recipe?** Like, from a recipe book? But, but, it conflicts with my ~~TMI~~ ~~NEI~~ JEI! Not to mention, real Steves remember the recipes! Burn that one or something, I just don't want to see it again.
* Phew, these took a while. Time to enjoy my comfortable... **JAVA EDITION**? ...wait, so is that still the real Minecraft? **AWAY WITH THIS SIGN!**
* Hey, look, an Enderman! Let's feed him the leftover trash, what could possibly happen?

# Screenshots
Finally. You have finished reading through all the mess supposed to explain what the mod is, or just scrolled all the way down there, and understand few enough to want to see the screenshots. Certainly a rational thing to do in our book. Except, there's a slight problem — no screenshots are to be found! Turns out that it is very hard to accurately represent on a screenshot what exactly Foreport does, and that has forced us to make a short trailer video instead.  

<p align="center"><a href="treasures/Foreport.mp4"><img src="treasures/play.jpg" alt="Play"/></a></p>

Can't make anything out of the video? Let's be honest here, we hardly can as well. [Check out the video snapshots here!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/foreport/screenshots)

# Installation
Finally times two! You have finished reading through all the mess and inspecting the trailer video trying to spot the differences, and now want to download Foreport. ~~Except, there's a slight problem...~~

Foreport can be downloaded from within [GitHub](https://github.com/newbthenewbd/Foreport/releases/latest) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/foreport).

# Credits
Many thanks to the community of [The Forge Project Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/UvedJ9m) for providing modding help whenever it is needed.

Thanks to Endy, the Friendly Enderman™ of Foreport. Eating that snack made Endy sick.

Special thanks to Jens Bergensten, the author of the law that totally scientifically explains the reasons behind this mod. Jens, if You happen to be reading this, the inclusion in these credits was Your penance for allowing what Foreport reverts to happen in the first place.

Last but not least, the most special thanks go to [this great friend of mine](https://github.com/Buttpants) for the original inspiration behind the mod, increasing my motivation to code it by challenging my belief that it can be done, as well as the immense help with testing it in various environments.

For extra awesomeness, tell us about it, too!\*\*

**\*\*** While we don't offer any perks for donating, the aforementioned actions will increase our self-awesomeness too!
